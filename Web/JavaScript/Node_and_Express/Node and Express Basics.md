# Node and Express Basics

What is Node.js and what is Express.js?

Node is a JavaScript runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript outside of a browser, most notably on a server. Node has a lot of support and is fast, but it there's a lot that it can't do on its own.

Express is the most popular Node.js *web framework*. Web frameworks like Express let you do web server things like handle files at different URLs, serve static files, and add handling for HTTP *verbs* such as `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE`.
