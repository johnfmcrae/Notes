# CMake Basics

CMake is an build system. CMake lets you build C++ software projects, but it can also do a lot of other things like manage testing, packaging, and making installers.

## Installing

> Your CMake version should be newer than your compiler. It should be newer than the libraries you are using (especially Boost).
