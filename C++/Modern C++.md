# Modern C++

## Auto Almost Always

Whenever possible, use the `**auto**` keyword to initialize data. Benefits include:

- Requires value initialization (cannot write `auto i;`)
- Ensures correct type
- Makes code cleaner when long types are required
- Promotes programming to interfaces over implementations
