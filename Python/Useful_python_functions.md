# Useful Functions in Python

For the full list of Python's built in functions, see [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)

---

```py
str.join(iterable)
```

Concatenates the elements in `iterable` into a single string. Example,

```py
>>> a = ['ham','eggs']
>>> s = ''.join(a)
hameggs
```

---

```py
len(s)
```

Return the length of a list or a string

---

```py
range(stop)
range(start, stop)
range(start, stop, step)
```

Range returns an immutable sequence of numbers with the given inputs. Strictly speaking, it is not a function.
