# Installations, Set Up and Python in the Terminal

## Interactive Mode

To enter **interactive mode** from the command line, simply use the command `python3` or `python3.x` where *x* is your current version of Python.

To view all variables, use `dir()`

To delete a variable, use `del <variable>`

To get a newline use `\`

To quit interactive mode, use `quit()`

## pip package installer

To install from pip in the terminal, use

```sh
python3 -m pip install "SomeProject"
```

Note the first two commands, `python3 -m` as many installation instructions simply say `pip install "SomeProject"`
